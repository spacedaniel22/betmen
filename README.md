# betmen

### To run the project:

1. `git clone https://github.com/spacedaniel22/betmen.git`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in a browser, preferably Google Chrome.


### Limitations/known issues

- The login/sign up UI is not organized correctly, that's still need to be done with some CSS.
- I'm using system dependent emojis as icons, and they may be a little bit out of position sometimes.
